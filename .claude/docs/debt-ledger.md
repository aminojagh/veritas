# Debt Ledger

Every knowingly-taken shortcut in Veritas, recorded at the moment it was taken.

This is not a wishlist and not a bug tracker. It is the record of places where
we chose speed over correctness **on purpose**, so that choice stays visible and
reversible. See the `recording-debt` skill.

**Every entry has a Trigger** — the condition that forces repayment. Debt
without a Trigger is a wish.

**Status:** `open` · `paid` (with the Sub-step that paid it) · `accepted`
(deliberately permanent — with the reason) · `superseded` (the code it described
no longer exists).

## Entries

<!--
Copy this template for each new entry. Keep entries in ID order.

### DEBT-001 — <short title>

- **Status:** open
- **Opened:** Sub-step N.M (`.claude/docs/reviews/step-NNN-<slug>.md`)
- **Size:** S | M | L  (S ≈ under an hour, M ≈ half a day, L ≈ a Step of its own)
- **Location:** `path/to/file.py:42` — or the component name if it is diffuse

**What we did**
The shortcut, concretely. Someone reading this in two months must be able to
find the code without archaeology.

**What we should have done**
The correct approach, specifically enough to act on. Not "do it properly".

**Why we deferred**
Usually "not needed for this slice" — but say *why* it was not needed, because
that reasoning is what expires.

**Cost while unpaid**
What is worse because of this. What is blocked. What breaks, and for whom.
If nothing is worse, this is not debt — delete the entry.

**Trigger**
The condition that forces repayment. Prefer observable conditions over dates:
"before any real customer data is loaded", "when the corpus exceeds 5k
documents", "if retrieval latency exceeds 2s". This is the most important
field in the entry.

### DEBT-001 — Framework rules rely on discipline, not enforcement

- **Status:** open
- **Opened:** Sub-step 0.1 (`.claude/docs/reviews/step-000-framework-scaffolding.md`)
- **Size:** M
- **Location:** `CLAUDE.md` (the four non-negotiables), `.claude/skills/*`

**What we did**

Wrote the framework as instructions Claude is asked to follow. Nothing mechanical
stops any of it being skipped: Claude could commit despite "Amino commits", ship
a Sub-step with no Step Review, take a shortcut without a Ledger entry, or put an
unregistered term in a column name. `.claude/scripts/verify_framework.py` checks that the
framework's *documents* are wired together — it cannot check that the framework
was *followed*.

**What we should have done**

Enforce the mechanical subset with hooks in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `PreToolUse` on `Bash(git commit*)` — block, since Amino commits.
- `PostToolUse` on Write/Edit — warn when a source file changes but
  `current-state.md` has not, within the same Sub-step.
- A `Stop` hook running `verify_framework.py`.

Judgement-dependent rules (is this a shortcut? is this term a domain noun?)
cannot be hooked and will always rest on discipline.

**Why we deferred**

The framework is untested. Enforcing rules before knowing which ones survive
contact with real work would harden guesses — several of these rules will
probably turn out to be wrong or annoying, and hooks make them expensive to
change. Discipline first, mechanism once the rules have proven themselves.

**Cost while unpaid**

Compliance decays as sessions get long and context gets summarised — exactly when
care matters most and is least available. The failure is silent: a missing Ledger
entry looks identical to no debt having been taken. This directly threatens the
premise of the whole framework, which is that the record can be trusted later.

**Trigger**

The first time any framework rule is observed to have been broken in practice —
a shortcut found during a Step Review that was not on the Ledger, a missing
review section, a commit made by Claude, or an unregistered term found in code.
One occurrence is enough; do not wait for a pattern.
